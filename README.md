# Web-Design-Contest-Entry-Spring-2016
This is the first website I ever made, and I submitted it to the Dev Catalyst Web Design competition in Spring 2016. Brice Wyatt and I were named Code Champions for this project.

==========================
 Jackson's Teen Book Club
==========================

JTBC began in the summer of 2015 when I, Brandon Mingledorff, realized that I had nothing better to do. Along
with a couple of friends who shared my interest in reading, we started meeting up and having fun discussions about
the books we had read. As time progressed, the club grew, and it became something bigger than I had ever expected.

The website was created (by Brandon Mingledorff and Brice Wyatt) to attract more teens ages 13-18 to our group; 
to add more conversation, book ideas, or any other ideas that would help the club. The site went through many 
iterations before it became the one you see today. We had to make sure it was optimized to computers, phones, 
and tablets so that everyone could have a good experience on the website in this age of advancing technology. 
Much of our target audience uses tablets and other mobile devices often to do their reading and/or other 
activities, and nobody wants to look at a website that is not optimized for the device they are on, so 
responsiveness played a key role in the making of the website. When Brice and I partnered up, the skills 
we both brought helped to enhance the website even further. Working in groups also increased our ability 
to work together as a team.

 The Website
=============

- Our website looks great on desktop PCs. However, that is not all our website works on; it also works on mobile phones, tablets, and even Macs!

- We have every book that we've ever read for the club on the More Info page under "Past Books." We have the names linked to the Amazon page where you can buy them if you'd like to read them as well.

- Many websites do not have a favicon, however, since we knew how to add one, we did! Out of all of the favicons we could've chosen, we chose a simple picture of a book to represent our book club.

- Every good website should include at least one e-mail or phone link, and we have both. Every instance of the JTBC e-mail and phone number links to your computer's application that you chose to open mailto: and tel: links.

- The design of our website provides an easy to read, clean, and concise visual experience. Our color scheme consists of just two main colors (blue and white), so it is not too flashy or over the top, but it still attracts one's attention.

- The pages of our website are designed in a parallel structure to maintain a simple, concise theme. 

- Any information that you may want to know about the club is very easy to locate and access. The information is put into specific categories that make your visit to our website a helpful and fulfilling one. You won't leave our website without being satisfied!

- The fonts we chose are very imposing and easy to read, so you won't have to look for long to pick out the information you need.

- At the bottom of every page, we have fun facts and top 5 lists about reading to make the user experience more fun and interactive.

- Also located on every page is the JTBC Book of the Month section, which lets users of our website know what book the club is reading this month. It is on every page because the question "What book are we reading this month?" is the most frequently asked question that the staff and I get.

-Thank you for taking the time to check out our website, we really appreciate it!
