        <h2>JTBC Book of the Month: Deathly Hallows</h2>
        <p>
          In the last book of the Harry Potter series, Harry and his friends must defeat Voldemort once and for all by destroying horcruxes and surviving the Second Great Wizarding War. The author, J.K. Rowling, caps off the series wonderfully with this novel. You can purchase Deathly Hallows on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Deathly-Hallows-Book/dp/0545139708/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1454974125&sr=8-3" target="_blank">Amazon</a> and read along with JTBC!

        <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
        <p>
          Here's some fun facts about some of the greatest authors of all time!
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>William Shakespeare, the most famous playwright ever, has coined many common words we use today in the English language, such as 'belongings', 'addiction', and 'fashionable'.</li>
          <li>J.K. Rowling's real name is Joanne, and she does not have a middle name. The "K" initial comes from her grandmother Kathleen; she chose it after her publisher suggested she use a more 'masculine' name on her book covers, as they thought more books would be sold if readers thought that a man wrote them.</li>
          <li>P.L. Travers, who wrote "Mary Poppins" hated the movie version of her book that Walt Disney made. She thought it was "too colorful" and that the songs were awful.</li>
