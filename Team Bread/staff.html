      <p class="intro">
        I, Brandon Mingledorff, am the leader and founder of Jackson's Teen Book Club. I am currently a sophomore at Madison Academic High school, and I'm 16 years old. I was born in the great city of Jackson, Tennessee and I love basketball and reading. My favorite part about reading is comparing books to their film counterparts, if they have one of course. My favorite book series is, by far, Harry Potter. I am also the designer of the JTBC site you're on right now!

    <p class="intro"><strong>Sumeja Hrnji&#263; (Co-Founder)</strong></p>  
      <p class="intro">
        Sumeja Hrnji&#263; is the co-founder of Jackson's Teen Book Club, and she is also a sophomore at Madison Academic. Sumeja, or "Meja" for short, was born in the small European country of Bosnia and Herzegovina, near Croatia and Montenegro. She speaks 5 different languages fluently (Bosnian, English, Arabic, Swedish, and Russian), and can hold a conversation in a few others as well. Meja loves to read and her favorite book is "Witch and Wizard" by James Patterson.

    <p class="intro"><strong>Why We Started JTBC</strong></p>    
      <p class="intro">   
        We started JTBC because we noticed that many teens around Jackson had nothing to do during the weekends, and we wanted to introduce the idea of reading for fun to those aforementioned teens. At first, many of our friends were skeptical, but once they realized how much fun we'd have chatting about our books, they hopped on board very quickly. JTBC was founded in the Summer of 2015 and we'd like to continue holding meetings throughout all of high school. Eventually, once we graduate, I (Brandon Mingledorff) will hand down my position as leader to a younger member, and they will take control. For now, however, I'm very excited to welcome any new members that would like to join! Go <a href="contact.html">here</a> for information about joining Jackson's Teen Book Club today!

        <h2>JTBC Book of the Month: Deathly Hallows</h2>
        <p>
          In the last book of the Harry Potter series, Harry and his friends must defeat Voldemort once and for all by destroying horcruxes and surviving the Second Great Wizarding War. The author, J.K. Rowling, caps off the series wonderfully with this novel. You can purchase Deathly Hallows on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Deathly-Hallows-Book/dp/0545139708/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1454974125&sr=8-3" target="_blank">Amazon</a> and read along with JTBC!
